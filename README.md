# Mobile-Security-Bootcamp-Platform-Challenges
https://droidsec-cysc.netlify.app/
Overview
This repository contains the platform development and Android challenges I authored for a Mobile Security Bootcamp focused on penetration testing and vulnerability analysis within Android applications. The bootcamp covers key areas of mobile security, including APK decompilation, attack surface analysis, and penetration testing methodologies and tools.

The challenges within this project are designed to help participants gain hands-on experience with real-world security vulnerabilities in Android apps and develop the necessary skills to identify and mitigate these issues.

Covered Topics
Throughout the bootcamp, we covered key areas including:

Exploring WASP Mobile: Introduction to the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide and understanding its components.

Top 10 Mobile Vulnerabilities: In-depth analysis of the top mobile security risks, including common misconfigurations and flaws in mobile applications.

Hands-on APK Decompilation & Analysis: Techniques for decompiling and analyzing Android APKs to uncover vulnerabilities in source code, manifest files, and resources.

Android Permissions & Attack Surface: Detailed exploration of Android permissions and how to identify the attack surface of mobile applications.

Pentesting Methodologies & Tools: Introduction to common penetration testing techniques and tools used for mobile security assessments, including reverse engineering, fuzz testing, and network sniffing.

Features
Platform Development: The platform was built to host the mobile security challenges, provide progress tracking, and manage user submissions.

Android Security Challenges: A set of hands-on Android challenges designed to expose vulnerabilities and teach participants how to exploit and fix them.

User Authentication & Progress Tracking: A secure system for user sign-in, challenge tracking, and progress monitoring to gamify the learning experience.

Real-world Pentesting Tools: Integration with popular mobile pentesting tools like Burp Suite, MobSF, Jadx, and APKTool to simulate a real-world mobile security testing environment.
